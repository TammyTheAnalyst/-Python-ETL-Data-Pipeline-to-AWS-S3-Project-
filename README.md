 # 🛠️ Python ETL & Data Pipeline to AWS S3

 ---

**Project Description:**  

- This is a complete, end-to-end data engineering project built using Python. 

- It walks through the full ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process — starting with extracting a raw CSV file, 
cleaning and transforming the data using pandas, and storing the cleaned output in two formats: a local CSV and an AWS S3 bucket.

- A SQLite version of the data is also generated to simulate real-world scenarios where SQL inspection and lightweight databases are used for validation.

- This project simulates a typical workflow in modern data teams to turn messy source data into clean, accessible datasets for analytics, reporting, or machine learning. It serves as a foundational example of building and managing a working data pipeline from start to finish.

✅ This is my first fully structured data engineering project to showcase ETL skills, cloud integration, version control, and project organization — all in one pipeline.

## ✅ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** (pandas, boto3)
- **AWS S3** (cloud file storage)
- **SQLite** (optional, for local SQL-based inspection)
- **SQL** (for validation/inspection queries)
- **Trello** (task management)
- **GitHub** (version control, portfolio showcase)
